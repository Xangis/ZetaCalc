# ZetaCalc

A simple calculator app, not as nice as the free one that comes with Windows.
This was originally released at http://zetacentauri.com and was downloaded more
than 5000 times before being open sourced.

A prebuilt Windows installer is available in the installer directory:

## Development Status

This application is no longer actively maintained, and I'm unlikely to accept pull requests.
It was more of an experiment to build a basic calculator using C# than a serious product.
